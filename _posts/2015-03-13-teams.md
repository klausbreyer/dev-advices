### Teams

#### Environment

Streamline the dev environment for all devs. That does not necessarily mean, that every dev should use the same text editor/IDE. Everyone should use his/her prefered tools. But there need to be a consensus about some basic settings (like tab size, line breaks, â€¦).

##### Sample Configuration:

- Tab Size: 2
- Trim trailing whitespaces
- Ensure newline at end of file

#### Editor Configurations

Use [.editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/)-Files and write down your settings. You can then use plugins for your prefered text editors. At the same time you have a documentation, where every developer can rely on.

##### Plugins:

- Sublime: [editorconfig-sublime](https://github.com/sindresorhus/editorconfig-sublime)
- Atom: [atom-editorconfig](https://github.com/sindresorhus/atom-editorconfig)
- PhpStorm: [EditorConfig](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7294?pr=)

#### Vagrant

Extract your dev environment into a virtual machine and use Vagrant. When setting up the machine, try to be as close to your production environment as possible.

##### Advantages:

- Easy onboarding of new employees (`vagrant up` et Voila!)
- "Real world" tests of new code (if dev === prod)

Try to avoid the bash-based configuration. Use puppet or chef to describe your setup.

##### Advantages:

- You can streamline production system with development system
- Incremental updates to machines is as simple as `vagrant provision` (instead of a full `vagrant destroy` and `vagrant up`)
