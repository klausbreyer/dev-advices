# Some dev advices for your next big thing 
{: .text-purple}


If I had these advices before starting many of my latest projects, everything would be so much easier / better /easier! 

There's currently no reasonable ordering of topics. If you would like to add some advices, open up an issue or an pull request! You can contact me anytime - on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jollife), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/jollife) or [GitHub](https://github.com/johannesnagl)!
